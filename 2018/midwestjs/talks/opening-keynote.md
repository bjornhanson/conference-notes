# Opening Keynote - [Randall Koutnik]: https://github.com/SomeKittens

Talked a lot about making software that people actually want to use. Figure out their intentions and make what they want, not what you think they want. He said many ideas were from the book [Don't Make Me Think](http://a.co/4fqUom6).

## Book recommendations:
1. [Don't Make Me Think](http://a.co/4fqUom6) - Steve Krug
2. [Build Reactive Websites with RxJS](http://a.co/8OfXmWa) - Randall Koutnik
