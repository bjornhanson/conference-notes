# Practical Application of ngRx in Medical Research
- Speakers: Aspen Payton & Kirk Balderes (Mayo Clinic)

## Notes

Working on "Registry Assist" v2 research application at Mayo Clinic, need to improve UI/UX and code, as well as integrate Epic (new medical record rendor)

What problems can ngRx solve for them?
- Single store holds application state (no need to pass data around between componenets and/or directives)
- Streamlines data save (all modified data element values can be updated in the store and processed easily in single event)
