## Notes

About Webtasks
- You write everything in JavaScript
- Every end task is automatically an HTTPS endpoint
- Very simple web UI and CLI
- Is what is behind Auth0 hooks and rules
- It's FREE! (not intended for production workloads - 1 request per second, 30 second execution limit, 10 CRON schedules, 100kb of code per task, 500kb durable document storage per task)
- [Extend](https://goextend.io) is the paid version (Webtask.io gives access to stuff and give feedback before shipping features to Extend)

How is it different from other serverless functions?
- Specialized for Node.js
- Low configuration
- Highly customizable
- Extremely low latency
- Designed from scratch for web-based user interactions, rather than plumbing between back-end services
